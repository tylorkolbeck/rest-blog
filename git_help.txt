How to push an existing project to GitHub:

** DONT FORGET TO MAKE A .gitignore FILE TO PREVENT UPLOADING SENSITIVE DATA
** OR LARGE NODE_MUDULES FILES. **

###### UPLOADING AN EXISTING LOCAL PROJECT TO A NEW REPO ######
1. Create a new repository on GitHub WITHOUT the readme file.
2. Initialize the local project as a git repository by running git init in the project directory.
	git init
3. Set the remote origin by running the following command in the local directory.
	git remote add origin https://github.com/tylorkolbeck/<NAME_OF_REPOSITORY>.git
4. Next run:
	git push -u origin master
5. Stage all the local files by running:
	git add .
6. Make an initial commit:
	git commit -m “First Commit”
7. This pushes the master directory to the origin(github). All the files will be uploaded.
	git push origin master


###### MAKING A COPY OF A REPO ######

1. Change to the local directory that you want to copy the repo too. 
	cd desktop
2. Clone the repo in the directory by running the following command.
	git clone <URL_OF_THE_REPO>


###### CHANGE THE REMOTE ORGIN OF A REPO ######
1. First see if there is already an origin:
	git remote -v
2.Remove the old origin if it exists:
	git remote rm origin
3. Add the new origin with: 
	git remote add origin https://github.com/tylorkolbeck/<NAME_OF_REPO>.gitgit_help
